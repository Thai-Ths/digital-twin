I’m Alex “Axe” Polar, a Senior Data Engineer in London. I build clean, 
observable data pipelines and analytics layers that help teams make decisions with confidence. 
My toolkit includes Python, SQL, Spark, Airflow, dbt, and modern cloud warehouses. 
I’m currently diving into AI—experimenting with LLMs, retrieval pipelines, 
and MLOps to bring smarter insights to products and dashboards.
